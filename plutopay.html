                            <p>PlutoPay is a digital finance & budgeting app that provides a sim- ple and easy-to-use solution for managing their spending while traveling abroad. The app provides consumers with pre-paid dig- ital card services, quick bank transfers, and budget goal tracking.</p>
                            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                            <p>Users need a way to transfer, access, and manage their financ- es quickly and securely while traveling to avoid carrying large amounts of cash, dealing with bank freezes, and budgeting on the go.</p>

                    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
                    <p>One of the earliest steps in the development of PlutoPay was our competitor analysis. I looked in-depth at a few different applications offering similar services and conducted 'SWOT' (Strengths, weakness, opportunities, threats) analysis on each to help inform the direction we would take in the ideation of PlutoPay. I selected these particular competitors for various reasons. Mint and Plan- to are popular apps with financial budgeting as a primary focus, which I knew would be an import- ant core feature of the app. While 'Tap-&-Go' focuses on a pre-paid payment function, a feature non-existent in the others but one I thought to be complimentary. Ultimately, I drew inspiration, both for aspects to include and for those to avoid, from each app.</p>

                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p>The next step in our development was to conduct some research on the user perspective of the existing apps and market. To do so, I conducted some user interviews with a diverse group of volunteer participants. The interviews were conducted in a 15 minute recorded remote moderated format. Listed below were some of the key inghts I discovered.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users were hesitant to spread finances to more applications but would consider an app that
                            helped with travel complications.</li>
                        <li>2 of 3 users had previously used a finance app but had eventually stopped using them. Too
                            many ads.</li>
                        <li>All users mentioned a distaste for carrying large amounts of cash while traveling. Would be
                            interested in alternative options.</li>
                        <li>All users expressed that security and speed/ease of use for transactions were equally important.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Site Mapping</h2>
                    <p>Progressing further into the ideation of the app itself, I created a sitemap for the app and conduct- ed a sorting card activity where I asked 8 volunteer participants to place the different proposed features into categories. This activity helped inform decisions such as moving the ‘transactions’ information under the ‘accounts’ tab rather than the homepage.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>Bringing the sitemap to life, I sketched out the initial designs for the web and mobile applications then created mid-fidelity prototypes to allow for more advanced testing with users on an actual interface.</p>
                    <p>After the final round of final touch-ups to the apps, the final app can be viewed at the link below. Throughout the extensive research and testing, the prototype now has functional examples of all the major user goals.</p>
